# Numpy


NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source library used for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide variety of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is a fundamental library for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.


This repository contains my practice problems and exercises using **NumPy**, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. The goal of this project is to reinforce my understanding of NumPy concepts including arrays, indexing, broadcasting, mathematical operations, and more.
